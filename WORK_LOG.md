| 3.5.25  |  2:30-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                   I spent this time planning out the structure of the project on the whiteboards. I decided that I would use ArrayLists for most of it, and that Tries/TSTs wouldn't be necessary. Also, I decided how I would narrow down the full dictionary into candidates by checking the length. |
| 3.7.25  | 12:55-1:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                    I started the code for the general structure, leaving the edit distance for later. I'm realizing that the plan for making the candidates may not be as good as it needs to, since a length buffer wouldn't shorten it by THAT much. |
| 3.17.25 |  2:10-2:55pm  |                                                                                                                                                                 Finished the edit distance. I started with a version that was weird and recursive and not dynamic. Fixed it up and made it clean and hopefully it works. I haven't tested it yet. I also started on the sorting that would happen while I calculate the edit distance. |
| 3.19.25 | 12:45-1:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                             Worked on sorting the edit distances while I insert them, which I'm pretty sure works. However, my edit distance formula is quite broken. I spent some time debugging it and I solved a type where I used i instead of j in a nested loop. |
| 3.21.25 | 11:00:11:55am | I got everything working now and passing the test cases, but I do have to sort the given dictionary alphabetically for it to work. There were a few bugs which I found through the debugger, but I fixed them. Unfortunately though, I'm running into another bug with the test cases even though it was working a few hours ago so I have to figure that out before I go on to create a main loop that will allow the program to run. |
| 3.23.25 | 11:00-11:30am |                                                                    The reason it stopped working was because I changed the initial limiting from a magic number of four to the given threshold. This excluded some results that should have been correct and caused the test cases to fail. I realized I needed to add an extra buffer length of 1 to the threshold. I'm going to make the main loop now that all the test cases pass. |
| 3.23.25 | 11:35-12:10am |                                                                                                                                                                                                      I finished up the main method and now I have a working version of autocorrect in the command prompt. It works well and runs pretty quick, I could add a better technique to create candidates now, but that's for tomorrow maybe. |
| 3.23.25 |  1:00-1:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I added comments to everything and made sure it all makes sense. Tested one more time and it's good to go. |
