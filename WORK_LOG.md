| 3.5.25 | 2:30-3:00pm  | I spent this time planning out the structure of the project on the whiteboards. I decided that I would use ArrayLists for most of it, and that Tries/TSTs wouldn't be necessary. Also, I decided how I would narrow down the full dictionary into candidates by checking the length. |
| 3.7.25 | 12:55-1:45pm |                                                  I started the code for the general structure, leaving the edit distance for later. I'm realizing that the plan for making the candidates may not be as good as it needs to, since a length buffer wouldn't shorten it by THAT much. |
